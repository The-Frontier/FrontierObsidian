# Introduction
The following is meant to define the structure of the FIC (previously IAC) branch of 'The Frontier' organization going forward into v4.0 and the release of 1.0. 

## Structure
This Organization will be lead by an individual or individuals with rank/title of "Division Commander" within the Frontier and as CEO within FIC. There will be three branches of the org:
1. Procurement - Concerned with the retrieval of goods and materials.
2. Manufacturing - Concerned primarily with the use, refinement, and maintenance of materials
3. Logistics - Concerned with the transfer of goods between operating bodies, warehouses, trading depots, etc

## Leadership
Leadership within the branches of FIC will be individual(s) containing the rank of "Company Commander" within the Frontier and COO:Branch (Chief of Operations: Procurement) within FIC. 

Further leadership (Team leader, squad leader, etc) will be determined on an as-needed basis for participation in large or inter-org operations. Eligibility for assignment as team lead will be based on competency and qualification with third-party tools needed for the operation (regolith, DCS-SRS, etc.). An incentive program should be implemented by COOs/CEOs to encourage qualification.
## Expectations and Requirements
### Base Membership Requirements
base membership into the FIC will be based upon a simple competency training defined by CEOs in a different document.

### Branch Requirements(Suggestions)
Becoming a member of a specialized branch of FIC should be more stringent in its training requirements and participation within organization events. Access to branch resources should require active time spent as a participating member, and access to advanced resources should require inter-org participation as well.

Being able to show some leadership capabilities/ability to command mulitple ships/players on a group outing should be considered before becoming a full member but utimately should not be the deciding factor.

### In-Branch Specialization
In-Branch Specialization could be deemed too complex to benefit FIC. It will lead to an overspecialization of members and then require more members to carry out the work needed.

## Planning for the Future
- With the coming of Guilds and Tech-research, it will be prudent to consider where FIC should focus its resources on what will permit the maximum net-gain/time. As a standalone-organization, FIC should focus its intent on resource-detection systems.

- If it is deemed prudent to multi-plex organizations for multiple realms of training, FIC will again work with COOs of child-orgs to determine where best to assist its child orgs

# Procurement: Frontier Procurement Agency
The Procurement branch of FIC will be primarily concerned with Mining and Salvaging operations within the 'Verse. It is likely that the Procurement Branch will be the branch most concerned with intra-org cooperation. They will work with Logistics and both combat branches to develop, maintain, and defend resource-acquisition avenues including but not limited to: Mining sites, salvaging battlefields, and assisting in the building of Resource-Allocation outposts

# Manufacturing: Frontier Steel-Works
The Manufactoring branch will be the most multi-discipline branch of the FIC. Manufactoring will be the home of planetary building operations. These operations will include not just construction, but also the refinement of goods brought in from Procurement. Manufacturing will also be home to the Engineering Corps of the Frontier and FIC.
# Logistics: Frontier Logistics Inc.
While on the face, the Logistics branch of FIC will have the least diversity in its mission statement, though it will have the most depth. The two major missions of Logistics will be:
1. The movement of goods from Active Operations Groups, Allocation facilities, and major storage depots
2. The maintenance of warehouses and supplies(spreadsheet simulator
3. The allocation and usage of goods
This branch will also have the breadth of SOPs defining minimum supply amounts, the ability to requisition materials from procurement, managing requisitions from other branches, etc.
