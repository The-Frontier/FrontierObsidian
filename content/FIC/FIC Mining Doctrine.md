# Introduction
The following document is an outline of the current mining doctrine for the Frontier Industrial Cooperative as of game version `3.24.2`. This Doctrine specifically applies to any operations hosted by FIC. 
## Visitors
If you or your org has been invited to participate in an FIC mining event, and there is a conflict between your org's doctrine and the doctrine defined below, contact Seriphai or Detroyer to discuss accommodations needed for your participation.

# Doctrine 
## Tools used
### DCS-SRS
The Fronter uses Discord and DCS-SRS for multi-group communication. We operation on the Od3ica Relay Server that can be found [here](https://srs-citizen.app)
Mining and Logistics ships should be in their own discord channel so that crews can coordinate efforts without interfering with other crews.

Command Channel `369.369` - Captains and/or Team Leaders for each crew should be in this channel

### Regolith.Rocks
[Regolith.Rocks](https://regolith.rocks/) is a fan-made site used to record mining and salvaging sessions. Participation in a Frontier Event requires logging into Regolith and joining the active mining session.

## Profit Sharing
In the spirit of teamwork, the Frontier institutes an "all-for-all" profit sharing system. Each and every mineral mined in the participation of a Frontier Mining Event should be recorded in Regolith and the profits are distributed to all participants in the event.
#### Shares System
All participating members are assigned 4 shares of the profits from mining activities. Owners of Active Moles are afforded an additional share to offset fuel/module replacement costs. See [[#Fleet Composition]] for more information about Active Moles.
* for internal events ONLY: Team Leaders officially qualified in regolith and SRS receive an additional share as well
#### Receiving Payment
Refinement activites can take some time, up two 4 days. Payment status is recorded in Regolith and you should be able to check receipt of payment at any time. Make sure that your Regolith name is an exact match to your in-game name.
