# Enhancing Communication in Star Citizen: How *The Frontier* Uses DCS-SRS

## Introduction
In the vast expanse of Star Citizen, effective communication can mean the difference between success and failure during intense space operations. To maintain clear, reliable communication, *The Frontier*—our organization in Star Citizen—uses DCS-SRS (Simple Radio Standalone). Originally designed for DCS (Digital Combat Simulator), DCS-SRS provides a robust, realistic radio communication tool that aligns well with Star Citizen’s immersive environment. Here’s how DCS-SRS enhances our operations and gives *The Frontier* an edge in the galaxy.

## What is DCS-SRS?
DCS-SRS is a standalone radio mod developed to complement DCS, but its potential for other flight simulators and space sims like Star Citizen has made it popular in our community. DCS-SRS mimics real radio communication by providing multiple radio channels, push-to-talk functionality, and custom sound effects that simulate actual radio transmissions. It allows players to manage separate frequencies for different teams or flight groups, adding layers of realism and operational control.

### Key Features of DCS-SRS
- **Multiple Radio Channels**: Organize your team by separating communications (e.g., Combat, Exploration, Logistics).
- **Push-to-Talk (PTT)**: Emulates real communication controls, adding authenticity and reducing channel clutter.

## Why *The Frontier* Uses DCS-SRS in Star Citizen
In Star Citizen, communication is vital for coordinating fleet movements, synchronizing ground and space activities, and ensuring everyone is on the same page. *The Frontier* uses DCS-SRS for several reasons:

1. **Realism and Immersion**: Just like the realistic gameplay Star Citizen provides, DCS-SRS brings that same feel to our comms. It makes operations feel authentic and aligns with the “simulator” aspect of the game.
  
2. **Improved Tactical Coordination**: In multi-crew or multi-ship operations, clear communication prevents chaos. DCS-SRS allows us to split channels based on roles or objectives, so combat pilots, medics, and logistics crews can communicate without stepping over each other.

3. **Distress and Emergency Signals**: With custom radio channels, DCS-SRS allows us to set up dedicated distress frequencies or emergency lines. This setup ensures that if something goes wrong, our team can quickly broadcast requests for reinforcements or medical support without clogging general channels.

## Setting Up DCS-SRS for Star Citizen
Here’s how *The Frontier* sets up DCS-SRS for use in Star Citizen:

1. **Installation and Configuration**: Install DCS-SRS and configure it for Star Citizen. Since DCS-SRS isn’t designed specifically for Star Citizen, there are some modifications we need to apply, such as mapping PTT keys to our in-game controls and adjusting audio settings to match the game’s audio environment. Seriphai, one of the CEOs of the Frontier Industrial Coop, has prepared a youtube video defining how we setup DCS-SRS for frontier operations:

> Due to security concerns, the DCS-SRS file is kept separate from the video and discord now. In order to recieve frequency sheets, please contact your Company or Division Commander

2. **Assigning Frequencies**: Each Division has a set of frequencies assigned to them, and other aspects of the Division also has sub-frequencies. a small example:
   1. Rangers Freq
	   1. Pathfinders
	   2. Mechanized
   2. IAC Freq
	   1. Mining
	   2. Salvaging
   3. Outlaws
   4. Officers
   5. Main

## Use Cases of DCS-SRS in *The Frontier*
### 1. Fleet Coordination during Large or Intra-Org Missions
On patrols, each ship or crew has its own role. We utilize discord for "local" or "team" communications, with team leads operating on a "command frequency" to communicate with other parts of the operation


## Benefits of DCS-SRS for Star Citizen Organizations
Using DCS-SRS allows Star Citizen organizations like *The Frontier* to establish clear roles, maintain operational security, and create a professional-grade communication network. Here’s how it benefits us:

- **Enhanced Teamwork**: By giving each role a dedicated channel, team members can focus on their tasks and rely on their comms without the distraction of overlapping conversations.
- **Operational Security**: Secure channels reduce the risk of sensitive information leaking across unnecessary channels, which can be critical in PvP scenarios.
- **Realistic Immersion**: DCS-SRS’s range and positional audio simulate real radio conditions, making interactions feel authentic and enhancing the game’s immersion.
