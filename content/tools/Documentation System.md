# Introduction
In an effort to create an easy to navigate and easy to read repository for information pertaining to the organization, The Frontier utilizes the [Quartz SSG](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) alongside the [Obsidian Markdown notes Editor](https://obsidian.md/) to service our documentation needs. The current iteration of this website is run in a docker container hosted by Seriphai and maintained by Detroyer and Seriphai together.

# Getting Started
If you are a Division or Company Commander; or perhaps an enterprising up-and-comer in the organization and you would like to assist in the maintenance and creation of documentation for The Frontier, you can watch the following video on how to get started.
