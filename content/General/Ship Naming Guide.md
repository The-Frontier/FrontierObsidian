# How to name your ship
This is not a requirement for joining the org. Nobody wants to force you to name your own ship a certain way. However with this guide, we can bring a bit more cohesiveness into the fleet, which we can then use to quickly identify each other and which part of the org, the ship belongs to.

### Rangers
Ships belonging to the Rangers Division should start their name with **FR**. All ships that are used by members of the Rangers within that Division should bear that beginning. This also includes Support and Combat Logistic Ships.

### Outlaws
Ships belonging to the Outlaws Division should start their name with **FO**. Like with the Rangers, Support and Logistics Ships involved with the Outlaws should bear that name.

### Frontier Industrial Cooperative (FIC)
Ships used within the Frontier Industrial Cooperative, should start their name with **FIC**. Unlike the other organizations, only civilian/industrial ships with minimal armament should bear that name. No war ship is allowed that name, to be able to better distinguish between civilian and military ships. Ships allowed to bear the **FIC** name are mining, cargo and manufacturing ships.
